##Description

In This Already Anticipated (By FGJTurku) Epic Game, The Player Will Releases A Heroic Panicbound Kid Inside!

In this highly polished a single computer co-operative game, you take role off two Snakes facing the perils of this mysterious world. As the world emotionlessly pushes forward these two snakes try poetically cope the struggles they face. With power of their imagination, they give each other unfamiliar powers they never imagined (?) before.


Play. Fail. Laugh. Challenge yourself and your (special) friend.

_"When I was a child, I had a toy. It was small synthesizer, with such mumble buttons, but with nice colors it made beautiful noices of Cocks, Doges, Cows and other farm etc. animals... This is how I become familiar with farm animals and such... As a child that toy made my world more interesting and bright place... Also animal noices."_
