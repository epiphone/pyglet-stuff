_"When I was a child, I had a toy. It was small synthesizer, with such mumble buttons, but with nice colors it made beautiful noices of Cocks, Doges, Cows and other farm etc. animals... This is how I become familiar with farm animals and such... As a child that toy made my world more interesting and bright place... Also animal noices."_
