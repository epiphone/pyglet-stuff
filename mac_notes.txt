Get python2.7.x and pip from homebrew. Setup path for brew python version before system built-in python.


Current Pyglet distribution on pip behaves badly on 64-bit OSX.

-> Get and install it straight from mercurial repo:

   pip install hg+https://pyglet.googlecode.com/hg/

Now game.py should run the game.
